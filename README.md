Master Thesis in Statistical Sciences at University of Bologna

Title: Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection with Multi-Source Data

Data: 
- Textual Data from Log Messages produced by different softwares and logging services running on several machines
- Numerical Data from Monitoring Process. So, different metrics representing the health status of machines were given. (e.g. CPU usage, load averages, etc.)



Main Techniques used:

- Natural Language Processing
- Clustering Algorithms: DBSCAN, K-Means
- Principal Component Analysis
- Time Series Outlier Detection
